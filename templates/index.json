Built from extruded aluminum planks, the deck is fully configurable so you can bolt on, remove, or rearrange accessories to fit whatever you’re into — work, travel, or play. You’re never locked into one setup, and your flatbed can evolve as your needs change.</p><p><br/>On top of that, it’s engineered to flat pack ship straight to your door with no freight depot and no welding required. It’s designed to be universal too, so if you ever upgrade trucks, you can take it with you as long as the new rig has a similar size and bed length. One bed, endless possibilities.</p>",

Over the past five years working in the off-road industry, I’ve watched the space evolve and gained a clear perspective on where it’s going. One thing has stood out above all: we can build thoughtful, highly functional products right here in the U.S. that genuinely serve the people who use them.<br/><br/>Flatbeds have always caught my attention, but most options felt overbuilt, overly specialized, or too fixed in their design. I wanted to create something modular, a system that adapts alongside your needs instead of locking you into a single setup.<br/><br/>That idea sparked Far Out Flatbeds. By building around extruded aluminum, we created a platform that is incredibly strong, highly versatile, and designed to evolve. The core principle is modularity: a flatbed that adapts to you, your truck, and your lifestyle — not the other way around.<br/><br/>Far Out Flatbeds isn’t just about manufacturing truck beds. It’s about redefining what a flatbed can be. We build products designed by enthusiasts for enthusiasts, rooted in innovation, practicality, and a clean, purposeful aesthetic.</p>",
